## Licensing, legal stuff

Rave It Out is 99% open source. The other 1% is because we need to encrypt songs, and thus the .dll/.so for encryption is closed source.

To follow the StepMania license we do not provide builds with mp3 support.

For specific information/legalese:

* All of the StepMania source code is under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
* The [MAD library](http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/) and [FFmpeg codecs](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) when built with our code use the [GPL license](http://www.gnu.org).
